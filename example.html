        <h2>Ten years ago..</h2>

        <p>Ten years ago a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court for a crime they didn't commit.
            These men promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade to the Los Angeles underground. Today, still
            wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune. If you have a problem and no one else can
            help, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire the A-team.</p>

        <p>One for all and all for one, Muskehounds are always ready. One for all and all for one, helping everybody.
            One for all and all for one, it's a pretty story. Sharing everything with fun, that's the way to be. One for
            all and all for one, Muskehounds are always ready. One for all and all for one, helping everybody. One for
            all and all for one, can sound pretty corny. If you've got a problem chum, think how it could be.</p>

        <p>Mutley, you snickering, floppy eared hound. When courage is needed, you're never around. Those medals you
            wear on your moth-eaten chest should be there for bungling at which you are best. So, stop that pigeon, stop
            that pigeon, stop that pigeon, stop that pigeon, stop that pigeon, stop that pigeon, stop that pigeon.
            Howwww! Nab him, jab him, tab him, grab him, stop that pigeon now.</p>

        <p>This is my boss, Jonathan Hart, a self-made millionaire, he's quite a guy. This is Mrs H., she's gorgeous,
            she's one lady who knows how to take care of herself. By the way, my name is Max. I take care of both of
            them, which ain't easy, 'cause when they met it was MURDER!</p>

        <p>Just the good ol' boys, never meanin' no harm. Beats all you've ever saw, been in trouble with the law since
            the day they was born. Straight'nin' the curve, flat'nin' the hills. Someday the mountain might get 'em, but
            the law never will. Makin' their way, the only way they know how, that's just a little bit more than the law
            will allow. Just good ol' boys, wouldn't change if they could, fightin' the system like a true modern day
            Robin Hood.</p>

        <p>Hong Kong Phooey, number one super guy. Hong Kong Phooey, quicker than the human eye. He's got style, a
            groovy style, and a car that just won't stop. When the going gets tough, he's really rough, with a Hong Kong
            Phooey chop (Hi-Ya!). Hong Kong Phooey, number one super guy. Hong Kong Phooey, quicker than the human eye.
            Hong Kong Phooey, he's fan-riffic!</p>

        <p>There's a voice that keeps on calling me. Down the road, that's where I'll always be. Every stop I make, I
            make a new friend. Can't stay for long, just turn around and I'm gone again. Maybe tomorrow, I'll want to
            settle down, Until tomorrow, I'll just keep moving on.</p>

        <p>Children of the sun, see your time has just begun, searching for your ways, through adventures every day.
            Every day and night, with the condor in flight, with all your friends in tow, you search for the Cities of
            Gold. Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah... wishing for The Cities of Gold. Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah... some day we will find The Cities

        <p>I never spend much time in school but I taught ladies plenty. It's true I hire my body out for pay, hey hey.
            I've gotten burned over Cheryl Tiegs, blown up for Raquel Welch. But when I end up in the hay it's only hay,
            hey hey. I might jump an open drawbridge, or Tarzan from a vine. 'Cause I'm the unknown stuntman that makes
            Eastwood look so fine.</p>
